Pet Elephants, for python 3.2 and pygame
John Bassage

So this is a thing, like a game but you can just watch it. I wanted to practice writing a pet. It won't work on its own like this, it isn't set up to be deployable at all. It needs to be opened in the python 3.2 IDLE and run from there, and it needs pygame and also it isn't . That's from pygame.org. They have their own documentation and looking that up will beat the hell out of me trying to remember what I did with it two years ago.

Once you have pygame, the main module of this elephants thing is petMaster.py. That's the one that needs to be run.
